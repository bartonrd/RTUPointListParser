README – Example{N} Folder
This folder represents a single test case for validating the automated output generation process. Multiple folders at this level (e.g., Example1, Example2, … ExampleN) provide different scenarios for testing.

Purpose

Input: Contains the original source files (e.g., point lists) that will be parsed and processed.
Expected Output: Contains the reference output files that represent the correct, validated results.
TestOutput: Contains the output generated by the Copilot AI tool. These files will be compared against the files in Expected Output to evaluate accuracy.


Usage Instructions


Process the Input
Use the files in the Input folder as the source for generating output.


Generate Test Output
Run the Copilot AI tool to produce output files and save them in the TestOutput folder.


Compare Results
Compare the files in TestOutput against the corresponding files in Expected Output:

Check for format consistency.
Validate data accuracy.
Identify any discrepancies for improvement.




Notes

Each Example{N} folder is self-contained and independent of others.
Do not modify files in Expected Output unless updating the reference standard.
Ensure naming conventions between Input, Expected Output, and TestOutput remain consistent for easy comparison.
